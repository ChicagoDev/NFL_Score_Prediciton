# Super Bowl Prediction Linear Model

## Overview

To predict the score of the Superbowl, I had to acquire, munge, and load one season of NFL statistics into a Python Pandas dataframe.

### Acquire
I scraped ~500 NFL games' statistcs from ProFootballReference.com using a custom Python script utiltizing the Beautiful Soup API.

### Munge

### Load
